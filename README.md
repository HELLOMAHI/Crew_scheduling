## Project Overview

This project models a simplified Airline Crew Scheduling problem and solves it using **backtracking** (constraint satisfaction). It demonstrates:

- modeling constraints (no overlapping flights per crew, minimum rest time),
- exhaustive search via backtracking,
- optional cost minimization,
- profiling time (and optional memory) vs number of flights,
- visualization via a Gantt chart.

The notebook `crew_scheduling_notebook.ipynb` contains code, plots, and analysis.
